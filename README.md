# rct

rct stands for remote copy text.

I've found that when I'm working remotely, there hasn't been a good way to copy text from remote to local.
This project is an attempt to solve this problem.

The requirements for this project is as follows:

1. Copy from remote to local should be as simple as `rct <my text>`
2. Exclusive remote/client relationship
3. End-to-End encryption
